# Geography (GEOG) 3404 Geographic Infromation Analysis (Python )
By Yaqian He, Department  of Geography, University of Central Arkansas
# Course Contributions
Several people helped me to develop this course by providing advice, data, or materials. Specifically, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Dr. Charles Severance from the University of Michigan, Earth Lab (https://www.earthdatascience.org/), and other open source materials (e.g., Xarray).

# Course Description
Analyzing geospatial data is a key component of GIScience and data analysis within the field of geography. This advanced GIS course is designed to introduce students the free and powerful programming language Python. Python is highly efficient for analyzing all kinds of data. This course provides introductions to basics of Python programming and use Python to read/write spatial data from/to different file formats, visualize data, create interactive maps, and conduct spatial analysis. This course works with data in general and geospatial data in particular, aiming to improve studentsâ€™ Big Geospatial Data analysis skillsets.

# Course Outcomes
After completing this course, a student will be able to:
1.	understand fundamentals of Python and its syntax
2.	import a time series dataset using pandas, use the datetime object to create easier-to-read time series plots and work with data across various timeframes (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly), and subset and resample time series data.
3.	import a vector dataset (e.g., shapefile) using geopandas, view the coordinate reference system (CRS) in Python, and reproject, clip and dissolve vector data 
4.	import a raster dataset using Xarray, plot raster histograms, review raster CRS, resolution, and extent, classify, crop, and reproject raster data, and read and open multiple remote sensing datasets, such as Landsat
5.	visualize geospatial data using Matplotlib
6.	conduct statistical analysis, including trend analysis, linear regression analysis, mean difference test, and correlation analysis
7.	use Python to address spatial problems
